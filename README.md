# OilyGiant Mining Company: Well Location Selection
## Project Overview
This project aims to help OilyGiant Mining Company find the best location for new oil wells. The main objectives are to:

Collect parameters for oil wells in selected regions, focusing on oil quality and volume of reserves.
Develop a predictive model to estimate the volume of reserves in new wells.
Identify oil wells with the highest predicted values.
Choose the region offering the highest total profit for selected oil wells.

## Tools and Libraries
The project utilizes the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scipy
scikit-learn

## Data
The analysis is based on data from three regions, evaluating the potential profitability of developing new wells. The budget is set at $100 million USD for the development of 200 wells.

## Results
Region 1 was identified as the best location for new development, with an estimated profit of approximately $34,000,000 and very low risk of loss.

## Setup Instructions
Clone the repository.
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy scikit-learn
Run the main script to execute the analysis
